# Bucket Balls

Bucket Balls lets you connect multiple devices (Smartphones, Laptops,...).
Each device becomes a "Bucket". You can create some colored Balls inside a bucket.
If the device supports the "deviceorientation"-event you can slop the balls inside a bucket
into another bucket. You can define rulesets to define which bucket is allowed to
drop its balls in which other buckets.
Buckets Balls is build with Node.JS and box2d. It's a fun weekend project,
so I wont commit it to the NPM repository since I dont know if I will be able
to maintain it in future.
